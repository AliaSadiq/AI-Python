# AI-Python
This GitHub repository serves as a comprehensive collection of Python  code samples that revolve around the fascinating field of Artificial Intelligence (AI).

<b>OnlineComputerShop(week#1):</b>
<br>An online computer shop sells customized personal computers. Every
computer sold includes a basic set of components costing $200 and
additional items can be added.As well as the basic set of components every computer must include one case, one RAM, and one Main Hard Disk Drive from the table.<br>
A computer is supplied with or without an Operating System.<br><br>
Write and test a program or programs for the online computer shop.
Your program or programs must include appropriate prompts for the entry of
data; data must be validated on entry.<br>
Error messages and other outputs need to be set out clearly and understandably.
All arrays, variables, constants and other identifiers must have meaningful names.
You will need to complete these three tasks. Each task must be fully tested.<br>
<b>Task 1 – Setting up the system and ordering the main items.</b>
write program to :
use arrays to store the item code, description and price
allow a customer to choose one case, one RAM and one Main Hard Disk Drive
calculate the price of the computer using the cost of the chosen items and the
basic set of components
store and output the chosen items and the price of the computer.<br>
<b>Task 2 – Ordering additional items.</b>
Extend TASK 1 to:
allow a customer to choose whether to purchase any items from the other
categories – if so, which item(s)
update the price of the computer
store and output the additional items and the new price of the computer.<br>
<b>Task 3 – Offering discounts.</b>
Extend TASK 2 to:
apply a 5% discount to the price of the computer if the customer has bought only
one additional item.
apply a 10% discount to the price of the computer if the customer has bought two
or more additional items.
output the amount of money saved and the new price of the computer after the
discount.

<b> Week #2</b>
An electric mountain railway makes four return trips every day. In each trip, the train
goes up the mountain and back down. The train leaves from the foot of the mountain
at 09:00, 11:00, 13:00, and 15:00. The train returns from the top of the mountain at
10:00, 12:00, 14:00, and 16:00. Each train has six coaches with eighty seats available
in each coach. Passengers can only purchase a return ticket; all tickets must be
purchased on the day of travel. The cost is $25 for the journey up and $25 for the
journey down. Groups of between ten and eighty passengers inclusive get a free ticket
for every tenth passenger, provided they all travel together (every tenth passenger
travels free). Passengers must book their return train journey, as well as the departure
train journey when they purchase their ticket. Passengers can return on the next train
down the mountain or a later train. The last train from the top
of the mountain has two extra coaches on it.
The train times are displayed on a large screen, together with the number of tickets
still available for each train. Every time a ticket is booked the display is updated.
When a train is full, the word ‘Closed’ is displayed instead of the number of tickets
available.
Write and test a program for the electric mountain railway.
Your program or programs must include appropriate prompts for the entry of
data; data must be validated on entry.
Error messages and other outputs need to be set out clearly and understandably.
All variables, constants, and other identifiers must have meaningful names.

You will need to complete these three tasks. Each task must be fully tested.<br>
<b>Task 1 – Start of the day.</b><br>
Write a program to set up the screen display for the start of the day. Initialize suitable
data structure(s) to total passengers for each train journey and total the money taken
for each train journey. Each train journey must be totaled separately. There are four
journeys up and four journeys down every day.<br>
<b>Task 2 – Purchasing tickets.<b><br>
Tickets can be purchased for a single passenger or a group. When making a purchase,
check that the number of tickets for the required train journeys up and down the
mountain is available. If the tickets are available, calculate the total price including
any group discount. Update the screen display and the data for the totals.<br>
<b>Task 3 – End of the day.</b><br>
Display the number of passengers that traveled on each train journey and the total
money taken for each train journey. Calculate and display the total number of
passengers and the total amount of money taken for the day. Find and display the
train journey with the most passengers that day.
