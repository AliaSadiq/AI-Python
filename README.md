This GitHub repository serves as a comprehensive collection of Python  code samples that revolve around the fascinating field of Artificial Intelligence (AI).

<b>OnlineComputerShop(week#1):</b>
An online computer shop sells customized personal computers. Every
computer sold includes a basic set of components costing $200 and
additional items can be added.As well as the basic set of components every computer must include one case, one RAM, and one Main Hard Disk Drive from the table.<br>
A computer is supplied with or without an Operating System.<br><br>
Write and test a program or programs for the online computer shop.
Your program or programs must include appropriate prompts for the entry of
data; data must be validated on entry.<br>
Error messages and other outputs need to be set out clearly and understandably.
All arrays, variables, constants and other identifiers must have meaningful names.
You will need to complete these three tasks. Each task must be fully tested.<br>
Task 1 – Setting up the system and ordering the main items.
write program to :
use arrays to store the item code, description and price
allow a customer to choose one case, one RAM and one Main Hard Disk Drive
calculate the price of the computer using the cost of the chosen items and the
basic set of components
store and output the chosen items and the price of the computer.<br>
Task 2 – Ordering additional items.
Extend TASK 1 to:
allow a customer to choose whether to purchase any items from the other
categories – if so, which item(s)
update the price of the computer
store and output the additional items and the new price of the computer.<br>
Task 3 – Offering discounts.
Extend TASK 2 to:
apply a 5% discount to the price of the computer if the customer has bought only
one additional item.
apply a 10% discount to the price of the computer if the customer has bought two
or more additional items.
output the amount of money saved and the new price of the computer after the
discount.
